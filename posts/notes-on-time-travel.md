The concept of time travel, for the majority of people, comes from science-fiction films or novels. We are normally used to two kinds of conceptions: the first kind, the "*Back to the Future*" one, states that, using a device such as a time machine (or a DMC-12 "DeLorean"), you could go back and forth in time as you please and whatever you do will have repercussions on the only existing timeline; the second kind, instead, admits the existence of multiple timelines (whatever that means) and states that your action in a time that is not properly yours (i.e. every time you travel in time) generates an alternate reality.
While I believe that this two conceptions are both erroneous, I still think there are some good intuitions about them.

# But what does time travel mean?
What is the actual process of time travel? In my view, time travel translates into modifying entropy (probably an improper analogy, but if you know about entropy in its most non-scientific definition you get the idea): the only way we could travel back or forward in time would be acting on the biological processes - every one of them, as a matter of fact - of the universe, making each atom of the universe return back to the state it was a moment (or years) before or forward to its next state, to travel, respectively, to the past and to the future. You see, this is, evidently, a more "universal" conception of time travel and would mean that there's no I or You who travels through time but we all do, as it's the whole universe the subject of these transformations. This seems to agree with the view of thinkers such as Alan Watts, about the pantheistic nature of being, but this is another matter.

# The problem
This solution, though, would incur in some wild problems if the universe reveals to be deterministic. That's because, if everything is already determined and we end up finding a way to revert those biological process (because we are meant to), if we travel back in time we would always end up to the same future, the only one possible. Thus, we would find ourselves inside a time loop where we would find a way back in time and then wait to rediscover that way again - because as we become who we once where we obviously lose all the knowledge and the experiences we've had - and that one first infamous success in time travelling would represent the "last day" of the universe, the ultimate event. 

That, of course, would only happen if we travel to the past and wouldn't happen if we only travel to the future, but why would we ever do that?
