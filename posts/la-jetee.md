The jetty is the end point and until I get there I voluntarily chose to document. Document everything, for no reason and for all kinds of reasons. Well, mainly, because I have things to say. Often. Hoping that this will remain as a path of traces - along with probably several other advantages that I'm not even considering right now - to show to the me "standing on the jetty" the whole process of getting there.
